Exercise: Create a REST API for managing a list of books.

Write a Go program that implements a REST API for managing a list of books. The API should support the following endpoints:

GET /books: Retrieve a list of all books.
GET /books/{id}: Retrieve details of a specific book by its ID.
POST /books: Create a new book.
PUT /books/{id}: Update an existing book by its ID.
DELETE /books/{id}: Delete a book by its ID.
Each book should have the following attributes: ID, Title, Author, and ISBN.

Practice creating appropriate data structures, handling JSON encoding/decoding, routing HTTP requests, and implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the book resource.
